## Airdrop 2020

A portion of the initial supply of cRING will been airdropped to the holders of RING & DOT.

On March 20, 2020 (GMT +8:00) Darwinia will take a snapshot of all RING & DOT holders, who will qualify to receive cRING tokens.

- DOT airdrop ratio: 1 DOT = 50 cRING
- RING airdrop ratio: 1 RING = 1 cRING

> The snapshot will contain all holders of ERC20 and TRC20 RING tokens, including those with deposit certificates in Gringotts. KTON is outside the scope of this snapshot and will not qualify for cRING airdrop.
