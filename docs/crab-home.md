Darwinia Crab Testnet (Crab for short) is a canary network with real econmics for Darwinia, The positioning of Crab is similar to Polkadot's Kusama Network. Expect Chaos is a reasonable expectation.

Crab mainly provides simulation environment for Darwinia's upgrade and application deployment, perform various radical experiments. Crab includes not only the complete software operation environment and network environment, but also the economic environment.

Crab is the first cross-chain NFT blockchain in Polkadot ecology, providing smart contract solutions, compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine, and supporting Dapps such as Defi and NFT to easily migrate to Polkadot.

Relying on the innovative bridge technology of the Darwinia Network, it also provides an entrance to the Polkadot ecology for projects that have been deployed on public blockchains such as Ethereum and BSC.

Crab also provides users with a very low transaction fee. Darwinia’s [Evolution Land](https://www.evolution.land/)'s new land has been opened on the Crab network, integrating NFT blind box Gamefi mining and other gameplays.

Crab is a long-term valuable network. Some RINGs are allocated to Crab Network as backing assets to make it serve as a canary network having real economic incentives and massive gaming theory testing, not just working a testnet.

Crab has the same parameters as Darwinia Mainnet, and use the same Staking mechanism and inflation model. Crab’s tokens are CRING and CKTON, the initial supply of CRING is 2000M, and the supply of CKTON is 0.

CRING and CKTON have got real value. There is an backing module on the Crab network. Darwinia initially reserved 40M RINGs as CRING's backing assets. These RINGs on the Crab network are called `Mapped RINGs`. In the lifecycle of Crab Network, `Mapped RINGs` is managed by Crab Council, and enables CRING and RING to be mutually swapable.

The swap of CRING and RING adopts a constant product market maker model similar to Uniswap, so in essence, the swapping process of CRING and RING is a market trading behavior. The initial liquidity is determined by the Crab Council.

** Crab Network is going to participate in the Kusama [Parachain Slot Auction](https://polkadot.network/launch-parachains/). **
